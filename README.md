# G40-Q3-Warmups

# How To:

### To start:

Fork this repo, then clone your fork.

```bash
git clone <git url for your fork of the repository>
```

Changed directory into the repository

```bash
cd G40-Q3-Warmups
```

Then, set the remote 'upstream' to the gSchool repo:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gSchool/G40-Q3-Warmups.git
```

### Every day:

First: get the new code from the upstream:

```
git pull upstream master
```

Second: Run npm install in the current days warmup folder.

```
npm install
```

Each warmup is its own npm project.

Third: Work on the warmup for the day. Check the daily plan for a link. To run the tests, look at the directions in the `problem.js` file
